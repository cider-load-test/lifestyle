title: initial items model
desc: |-
  Not necessarily a seperate model from the data model.
  Name, usage, effect, and optional meter rating. In other words, an item might look like this:
  name: shower, usage: 10 min, effect: 30 gallons, meter: 3 gpm
  In the case that a meter is present, effect should be calculated automatically as opposed to being entered by the user.
