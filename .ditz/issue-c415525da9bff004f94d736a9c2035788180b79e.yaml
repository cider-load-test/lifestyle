title: initial metric model
desc: |-
  Belongs to user, has many items. Belongs to many items would be more accurate of course, but whatever.
  
  Four properties:
  - usage_unit : the unit name for what the user actually does (e.g. "minutes" for shower, "miles" for car)
  - impact_unit  : the unit name for the impact of doing this (e.g. "gallons" [of water] for shower, "gallons" [of gas] for car)
  - ratio : the ratio of impact over usage; when only usage is present, multiply by the ratio to get the impact
  - name : the name of the metric (e.g. "car," "shower," "heater")
